Objective:
This prgram will allow the user to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer
-We will...
-create code that checks who won ech round
-create code that takes the input(choices) from the user
-create code that takes 'input' from the computer
-check if the user wants to quit OR if the user doesn't enter one of the options
-loop each round of the game
-add statements at the end and beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing

Pseudocode:
#set variable keepPlaying to ture
#While keepPlaying it true:

     #print statement welcoming player to the game
     #print statement stating the rules (best 2 out of 3 Press 'q' to quit)
     
     #make a key that assigns a number to each choise for the computer
     #(rock is 1, scissors is 2, paper is 3)
     
     #import the random funtion - the cimputer makes its choice randomly from this function
     
     #set computer's score to 0
     #set player's score to 0
     
     #while player's score is less than 2 and computer's score is less than 2: -- thins means that the game is still on
     
        #computer's choice = random number between 1 and 3 (random function gets used here)
        #player's choisce = input(ask playerto select rock, paper, or scissors)
        
        #start checking user options
        #useChoice = userChoice.lower()
        #if player inputs 'q': --player wants to end the game
        #   set keepPlaying to false -- ends the loop
        #   stop the loop --whoo! break statement
        
        #else if (player inputs rock and cimputer chooses rock) or 
        #(player inputs paper and computer chooses paper) or
        #(player inputs paper and computer chooses scissors):
        #   print out DRAW
        #   print out player's score and computer's score
